        "summary": "What does it mean to look back on a failed assassination? Why does one decide to forget a radical past? Inauguration looks at the fragmented history of the Young China Association (少年学社). Interweaving temporal connections with faint chances of synchronous events between two disparate events at the margins of Chinese revolutionary history: a failed assassination and an impossible trip. The film narrates a forecast of the past, wherein it renders visible the processes of erasure, remembrance, and archival anchors of the early overseas Chinese revolutionary politics and its aftermaths.",

        "summary": "Nan, my uncle, lives with his parents in a first-floor apartment in the southern Chinese city, Changsha. The apartment is in perpetual tension with talks of life and death, questions of belonging, and a good dose of humor. Lingering over everyday life, the film acquires a durational feel—things happen patiently, even as at times ‘nothing’ seems to. It is a meditation on time, aging, and the economies of care in contemporary China.",
        "reviews": "Zuqiang's film is neither long nor slow. It simply unfolds at the pace with which Nan and his parents move through the world—the rhythms to which anyone who is invited into their world would be asked to synchronize. Several scenes in the film follow Nan’s actions, sending our restless bodies out of sync. We learn about disability not only as symptoms in a body, but as social relationships—physical and temporal relationships that we too become implicated in. More than discerning narratives or plots, the work that the audience does in these scenes is about syncing with other(’s) rhythms. These are acts of love. The process is imperfect.  -  Sindhu Thirumalaisamy",

        "summary":"CCuba once had the largest Chinese community in Latin America. In 1847, the first group of five hundred Chinese workers arrived in Cuba as indentured workers. Through juxtapositions of the now-disappearing Chinese migrant worker community in Havana and the expanding investments in Cuba made by China, the film observes the visible and invisible traces of Chinese capitals in a Chinese nursing home, a Wifi park, a bio-power plant and sugarcane fields, punctuated by archival petitions from the Chinese 'coolies' in the late 19th century.",

        "summary":"During the Cultural Revolution, the accordion was the only permitted western instrument. With its rhythmic and performative quality, the accordion was favored as an instrument of propaganda. In the ’90s, when the piano and other instruments regained popularity, the accordion became less influential than it had been. However, the instrument is having a revival in the 2010s. The film looks at two accordion classes taught in Changsha, China: One for the primary school kids from mostly working-class families, as part of their school curriculum. The other for a group of middle-aged men and women that meet weekly at their leisure.",

The video blends personal observation of the natural landscape of Sierra Nevada, with the history of Chinese presence in Spain. Two styles of shots relate to the storylines of the two characters: Chi Chang and the artist himself, on two different observations, journeys and forms of collectivity in Spain 80 years apart.",

The film questioned if the so-called management of urban color is possibly only a wishful thinking from the ones in power.",
